# Iris Classification Web Application
- Created a web application that classifies the iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their sepals and petals.
- Optimized Random Forest Classifier to obtain the best model
- Built a client-facing web application using streamlit and deployed it on Heroku.

# Motivation
***The best way to learn is by doing. The only way to build a strong work ethic is getting your hands dirty.*** - Alex Spanos <br>
This inspired me to build my first web application for machine learning problem integrating my sofware engineering knowledge with data science and successfully hosting it on heroku.


# DataSet Information
- Data set contains 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
- The data contains 3 classes (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor) of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant

# Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7 </br>
**Packages Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit  </br>
**Web Framework:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` </br>
